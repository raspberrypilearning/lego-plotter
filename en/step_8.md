## What next?

+ Add a LEGO Technic Colour sensor to detect when the paper has run out

+ Modify the LEGO Technic Force sensor code so that the speed of the motor controlling the paper feed is increased by increasing the pressure on the sensor.

+ Add other data sources. You could use another external sensor or a feed for an online data stream. 

If you are following the [Lego path](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/pathway-name) pathway, you can move on to the [ProjectName](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/project-name) project. In this project, you will make a face from lego and use machine learning to make it react to different images..
