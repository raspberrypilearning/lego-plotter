## What next?

+ Add a LEGO® Technic™ Color Sensor to detect when the paper has run out.

+ Modify the LEGO® Technic™ Force Sensor code so that the speed of the motor controlling the paper feed is increased by increasing the pressure on the sensor.

+ Add other data sources. You could use another external sensor or a feed for an online data stream. 

If you are following the [Introduction to LEGO BuildHAT](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/lego-intro) pathway, you can move on to the [LEGO Data Dash](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/lego-data-dash) project. In this project, you will make some dials and readouts with LEGO and get them to display the air quality data from anywhere in the world!

If you want to have more fun exploring python, then you could try out any of [these projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=python).
