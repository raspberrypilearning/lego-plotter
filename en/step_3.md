## Building the plotter

Nowadays when data is collected froma sensor, it is typically uploaded to an online dashboard. However this requires a reliable connection to the INternet which may not always be available, if your sensor is located in a hut half way up a volcano or out on your school playing field. One solution is to record the data directly onto a very long roll of paper and this was a technique you may have seen in eartyhquake disaster movies where a [seismometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismometer) is used to show the impending tremors. 

The design of such devices is quite simple: one motor is used to move the paper across the pen (the x-axis) while another at right angles to the first moves the pen up and down in response to the changing data.

In this first step you will build a simple x/y plotter using LEGO. 

There are plenty of ways you could do this, but the build instructions for the LEGO Spike Prime Track Your Parcels project are a great starting point. 

[Part one](https://le-www-live-s.legocdn.com/sc/media/lessons/prime/pdf/building-instructions/track-your-packages-bi-pdf-book1of2-05883f81fed73ac3738781d084e0d4e2.pdf) shows you how to construct the base and the arm that will hold the pen.

You will need to adapt the build slightly so that the arm is able to hold a pen. Rubber bands are a great way to hold a pen snugly against LEGO.
