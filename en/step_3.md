## Simulated data

Before you use your plotter to record real data, let's test it with sime simulated measurements.


--- task ---

Open Thonny and add the following lines to begin your program by importing the libraries you will be using:

```python
from random import randint
from time import sleep
from build_hat import BuildHAT
```

--- /task ---

Now you can use the `randint` function to create a random value between a pre-defined range:

```python3
sensor_data = randint(0,100)
```

--- task ---

--- /task ---
