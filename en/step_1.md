### What you will learn

+ How to calculate angles of rotation
+ How to map data ranges onto appropriate scales for visualisation
+ How to use conditional statements (if/else)

### Hardware

+ A Raspberry Pi computer
+ A Raspberry Pi Build HAT
+ Two LEGO® Technic™ motors
+ A LEGO® SPIKE™ Force Sensor OR a push button, breadboard, and jumper wires
+ Assortment of LEGO®, including two small wheels (we used a selection from the [LEGO® Education SPIKE™ Prime
 kit](https://education.lego.com/en-gb/product/spike-prime))
+ A 7.5V power supply with a barrel jack (you could instead use a battery pack, but make sure that all cells are fully charged) 

### Software

+ Python 3
+ The Vcgencmd Python3 library
